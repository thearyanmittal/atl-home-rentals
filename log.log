- get unique vals in each column
- encode each and map them all to numerical values
    - need to parse and separate by keyword the columns [Rooms, Kitchen, Interior, Heating, Cooling, Construction, Parking, Amenities]
    - split descriptions into keywords, turn keywords into columns with binary values (has golf, has pool, etc.)
    - get geocoding data for coordinates on all
- seaborn correlogram and correlation heatmap

- which columns to use/not use?
