- get unique vals in each column
- encode each and map them all to numerical values (one-hot encode description-based columns by keyword)
    - need to parse and separate by keyword the columns [Style, Rooms, Kitchen, Interior, Heating, Cooling, Construction, 
    Roof, Parking, Amenities, Lot]
    - split descriptions into keywords, turn keywords into columns with binary values (has golf, has pool, etc.)
    - get geocoding data for coordinates on all

- standardize each column (z-score method)
- seaborn correlogram and correlation heatmap

- which columns to use/not use?
