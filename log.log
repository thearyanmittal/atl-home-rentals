TODO:
- view value distributions per column (again)
- cluster based on different features (e.g. zipcode)
- standardize each column (min/max)
- missing value imputation
- seaborn correlogram (account for empties)
- feature selection
- factor analysis (correlogram for factors to see difference)
- PCA (on dataset not factors)

- try different regression models on PCA loadings
    - compare performance across different numbers of components
    - k fold validation and testing
    - resampling techniques, different accuracy metrics, confusion matrix

- clean up code
    - type hinting and docstrings for all functions
    - wrap most code blocks into functions
    - add markdown blocks to replace comments and bundle code blocks that accomplish one task
