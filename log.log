TODO:
- missing data imputation (then correlation)

- factor analysis (correlogram for factors to see difference)
- standardize each column except price (min/max since most columns binary)
- feature selection (drop columns highly correlated with each other, drop columns not correlated with price)
- PCA (on dataset not factors)

- try different regression models on PCA loadings
    - compare performance across different numbers of components
    - k fold validation and testing
    - resampling techniques

- refactor code
    - type hinting and docstrings for all functions
    - wrap most code blocks into functions
    - add markdown blocks to replace comments and bundle code blocks that accomplish one task
    - use pd.get_dummies() for one hot encoding
- write pipeline to take new datapoints and make prediction on them

- sale prices for these same houses (as opposed to rental prices)?
    - can see if different features/factors correlate with sale prices as opposed to rental prices
    - which features/factors weighted more heavily in regression?
