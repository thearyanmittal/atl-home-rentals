- get unique vals in each column
- encode each and map them all to numerical values (one-hot encode description-based columns by keyword)
    - need to parse and separate by keyword the columns [Style, Rooms, Kitchen, Interior, Heating, Cooling, Construction, 
    Roof, Parking, Amenities, Lot]
    - split descriptions into keywords, turn keywords into columns with binary values (has golf, has pool, etc.)
    - get geocoding data for coordinates on all
- convert Year Built to Age
- clean up formatting for certain columns [Water]
- convert all categorical columns to one-hot encoding
- for duplicated entries, use only most recent one (if MLS# duplicated, use most recent entry)
- drop all location columns and just use zipcode
    - replace zipcode with column(s): median income, total households
- fix rental prices in dataset


- view value distributions per column (again)
- cluster based on different features (e.g. zipcode)
- standardize each column (min/max)
- missing value imputation
- seaborn correlogram (account for empties)
- feature selection
- factor analysis (correlogram for factors to see difference)
- PCA (on dataset not factors)

- try different regression models on PCA loadings
    - compare performance across different numbers of components
    - k fold validation and testing
    - resampling techniques, different accuracy metrics, confusion matrix

- clean up code
    - type hinting and docstrings for all functions
    - wrap most code blocks into functions
    - add markdown blocks to replace comments and bundle code blocks that accomplish one task
